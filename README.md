# <Prework-Study-Guide>

## Description

This project is a webpage designed to contain notes and annotations taken during my time in the prework portion of a coding bootcamp. I built it to help familiarize myself with web design concepts and ideas. This allows me to not need to take my notes down manually which can be quite time consuming. Doing this project taught me a great deal, from learning the basics of git and github, to writing my first webpage in HTML.
