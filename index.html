        <h2>CSS</h2>
        <ul>
          <li>CSS Notes</li>
          <ul>
            <li>Inline CSS: Apply Styling to a specific HTML tag and to that element alone.</li>
            <li>The Style element (Internal CSS): This element, located in the Head element contains the CSS rules for the webpage.</li>
            <li>External CSS: This Style Sheet is typically prefered, allowing developers to keep their CSS rules in a seperate file.</li>
            <li>Selectors: Define the elements or attributes to which the rules, or declaractions, will apply.</li>
            <ul>
              <li>The * Selector: This selector is a wild card allowing the declatrations made in the declaration block to apply to all elements in the effected webpage.</li>
            </ul>
            <li>The Box Model: <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Learn/CSS/Building_blocks/The_box_model">The Box Model </a></li>
            <li>Declarations ({}): contain two important components: the CSS property we want to apply and the value of the property.</li>
            <li>A period preceeding an selector designates that selector as a Class selector. So any HTML element with the class proceeding the period will be effected by the rules found within the selector's declaration box.</li>
            <li>Assigning Colors in CSS: Assigning colors in CSS can be done many ways: semantic references (gray, blue) and hexidecimally with the color's hexidecimal code.</li>
            <li>CSS Properties:</li>
            <ul>
              <li>Color:      Defines the color we want to use on the element.</li>
              <li>Margin:     Defines the amount of space we want around the outside of an element.</li>
              <li>Padding:    Defines the amount of space we want inside the element.</li>
              <li>text-align: Defines the anchor point for the alignment of the text in the affected element.</li>
              <li>border:     Assigns a border outlining the element.</li>
              <li>box-shadow: Adds a shadow effect around an element's frame. You can set multiple effects seperated by commas. The shadow is described by x and y offsets relative to the element, blur and spread radius, and color.</li>
            </ul>
          </ul>

        <ul>
          <li>JavaScript Notes</li>
          <ul>
            <li>Comments: These are snippets of text that can be added along with code. The browser ignore text marked as comments (/* */ = multiline comments) (// = single line comments)</li>
            <li>If Else Statements: If Else statements check if the statement inside the parentheses is true. If it is true then the if is triggered, if it is false, the else is triggered.</li>
            <li>Functions: These let you piece meal your code by removing it from the mainline function.</li>
            <li>Document: document.querySelector();</li>
            <li>For Loops: For loops are useful functions that repeat tasks a specified number of times.</li>
            <li>Events:</li>
            <ul>
              <li>addEventListener()</li>
            </ul>
            <li>Operators:</li>
            <ul>
              <li>Addition(+): Can add both numbers as well as combine two strings.</li>
              <li>Subtraction, Multiplication, and Division(-, *, /): These all do what you'd expect from basic math.</li>
              <li>Assignment(=): This assigns a value to a variable.</li>
              <li>Strict Equality(===): This performs a test to see if two values are equal, returning true or false depending on the result.</li>
              <li>Not, Does-not-equal(!, !==): This returns the logically opposite value of what it preceeds. When used intandem with an equality operator it tests whether or not the two values are not equal.</li>
            </ul>
            <li>Variables:</li>
            <ul>
              <li>String:  A sequence of text to signify the value as a string, enclosed in single quotationmarks.</li>
              <li>Number:  A number.</li>
              <li>Boolean: A true/false statement. The words true and false are special keywords that do not need quotes.</li>
              <li>Array:   This is a structure that allows you to store multiple values in a single reference.</li>
              <li>Object:  This can be anything. Everything in JavaScript is an object and can be stored in a variable.</li>
